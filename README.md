# Challenge-10
## In the assignement requirment from the Starter Code file, it is required to create a scatter plot using pca data by setting x="PC1" and y="PC2". But in the portal, it is required to create the scatter plot using pca data by setting x="price_change_percentage_24h" and y="price_change_percentage_7d". I believe the reqruiements in the starter code will represents better that the pca data results, the components "PC1", "PC2" may not be exactly "price_change_percentage_24h" and "price_change_percentage_7d". Therefore, I follow the requirments in the Starter Code file.
